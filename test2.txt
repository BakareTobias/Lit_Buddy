an-early-firedetection-method-based-on-image-processing.pdf->The paper presents an early fire-alarm raising method based on video processing. The basic idea of the proposed of firc-detcction is to adopt a RGB (rcd, green, hluc) model based chromatic and disorder measurement for extracting fire-pixels and smokc-pixels. The decision function of firc-pix& is mainly deduced by the intensity and saturation of R component. The extracted fire-pixels will be verified if it is a real fire by both dynamics of growth and disorder, and furthcrly smoke. Based on iterative checking on the growing ratio of flames, a fire-alarm is given when the alarm-raising condition is mct. Experimental results show that the developed technique can achieve fully automatic surveillance of fire accident with a lower false alarm rate and thus is very attractive for the important military, social security,commercial  applications, and so on, at a general cost. .

kahn2018.pdf->Berkeley AI Research (BAIR), University of California, Berkeley Abstract — Enabling robots to autonomously navigate complex environments is essential for real-world deployment. Prior methods approach this problem by having the robot maintain an internal map of the world, and then use a localization and planning method to navigate through the internal map.However, these approaches often include a variety of assumptions, are computationally intensive, and do not learn from failures. In contrast, learning-based methods improve as the robot acts in the environment, but are difcult to deploy in the real-world due to their high sample complexity. To address the need to learn complex policies with few samples, we propose a generalized computation graph that subsumes value-based model-free methods and model-based methods, with specic instantiations interpolating between model-free and model-based.We then instantiate this graph to form a navigation model that learns from raw images and is sample efcient. Our simulated car experiments explore the design decisions of our navigation model, and show our approach outperforms single-step and
