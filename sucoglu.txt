Abstract—In this study, designed firefighting robot especially 
for forest fires was analysed using Computer Aided Engineering 
(CAE) methods. Structural and thermal analyses were carried 
out after the frame and shell design of the robot body and 
material selection. To determine the structural strength of robot 
static forces (self-weight of the chassis and additional forces 
arising from other components of the robot such as wheels, 
pallet and diesel engine) were applied to chassis frame. To get 
more reliable results, the structural analysis was conducted with 
three different forces as 750, 1,000 and 2,000 kg. Occurred 
stress, strain, displacement and safety factor values were 
computed. In thermal part; a heat-insulating and fireproof plate 
was built. Robot shell was composed with three parts using; 
galvanized steel with the thickness of 5 mm as the main plate, 5 
µm cubic boron nitride coating for non-flammability and  50 
mm silica aerogel for  thermal insulation. After design and 
combination process, thermal insulation calculations and 
analysis were conducted using Matlab and Ansys Workbench 
Steady State Thermal tools. Heat energy of the fire was 
transferred to shell combination with convection and radiation. 
The temperature gradient of fire was derived using required 
logarithmic function. The numeric calculations and analysis 
were carried out for 30, 300, 900 and 1,800 seconds time 
intervals. The temperature variation of the ambient and inside 
area temperatures and insulation properties of the combined 
shell material were obtained from calculations and analysis. The 
results were compared. Structural analysis showed that the yield 
strength of the selected material for chassis (AISI 1018) was 
almost five times more than occurred maximum stress with 
2,000 kg forces. It was obtained from thermal computations and 
analysis that while temperature of the environment was almost 
1,450 °C, the inside area was about 34 °C. The designed and 
combined shell material provided extremely great insulation 
(about %98) that has vital importance for firefighting.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Since human kind first encountered with fire, besides the 
fact that they have utilized from it, they needed to combat 
against it. Along with this combat action, it can be considered 
that early intervention to fire, securing the lives of firefighters, 
and saving lives of people who trapped within the fire are the 
key elements of this combat. In Turkey; 1,200 forest fire 
incidents are reported; and 22,000 ha forest area is destroyed 
annually [1]. Despite knowledge of safety know-hows, people 
all over the world still confront frequent explosion and fire 
hazards [2]. Forest fires generally results in environmental 
pollution and destruction [3].  
MVF-5 [4] is a multifunctional firefighting robot that 
manufactured by Croatian company in 2013 DOK-ING to 
control the fires in unreachable areas and life threatening 
conditions. It is a remote controlled machine that operated 
with GPS-INS (Global Position and Inertial Navigation) 
System. MVF-5 extinguishes the fires with high-pressure 
cannon on hydraulic arm which pumps the water up to 55 
meters away without intervention of firefighters. This 
machine has a high temperature resistant shield and fireproof 
coating to protect the system from external high temperature 
conditions and big flames. MVF-5 is able to withstand 700 ˚C 
for 15 minutes or 400 ˚C for 30 minutes. It has capability to 
carry 2,200 liters water and 500 liters foam tanks. Usage areas 
of MVF- 5 are oil refineries and terminals, military storages, 
chemical plants and nuclear power plants. Martinson et al. [5] 
developed a robot (Octavia) which can be used as a team 
member for firefighting tasks in 2012. In the system, when 
human team leader indicates the location of the fire using 
speech-gesture and clears the obstacles, robot finds the exact 
location of the fire with its sensors and extinguishes the fire 
with CAF (compressed air foam) system. Octavia has 48 DoF 
in body, arms and head. It is mounted on a two wheeled 
Segway base for mobility. Robot uses the perceptual system 
to understand what team leader means and behaves correctly. 
Today, many computer-based tools have been available to 
help design and analysis cycle of robots [6]. Solid modelling 
using CAD methods assists the robot designers to define the 
parts and assembly of the system and to utilize the geometry 
in applications such as simulation, analysis and prototyping. 
Virtual prototype simulations, static, kinematic, dynamic and 
thermal analyses can be conducted with CAE methods [7]. 
 
In this article we focused on the structural and thermal 
analyses of designed firefighting robot. In structural part; 
static forces were applied to chassis frame to determine the 
structural strength of robot. Occurred stress, strain, 
displacement and safety factor values were computed. In 
thermal part of the study; thermal insulation calculations and 
analysis were conducted using Matlab and Ansys Workbench 
Steady State Thermal tools. 
II. DESIGN OF FIREFIGHTING ROBOT  
In the mechanical design process of the firefighting robot 
several issues were considered such as compact size, 
sufficient stiffness, toughness, management of time and cost. 
Components of the robot were drawn using parametric solid 
modelling technique. Subsequently, created parts were 
assembled to build up the 3D model. Design of the robot is 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
A. Design Specifications 
The robot was designed to carry out the special 
firefighting tasks that occur at open areas. These types of fire 
disasters generally occur at the forests and mountains. So it is 
too hard to reach to fire area using conventional firefighting 
vehicles. There are two main problems; hard terrestrial 
conditions and slope. To handle these problems; body shell 
of the robot was designed with the combination of galvanized 
steel with the thickness of 5 mm as the main plate, 5 µm cubic 
boron nitride coating for non-flammability and  50 mm silica 
aerogel for thermal insulation. That can be called as 
composite structure that provide light, non-flammability and 
excellent heat insulation features. By using this combination 
robot can be produced light, compact, fast and robust to 
operate in tough terrestrial environmental conditions.  
 
A special traction system that comprise the wheels and 
pallet was developed to answer the condition of working 
environment. Wheels and pallet were connected to robot 
chassis with hydraulic cylinders. If more speed is required for 
the case; the pallet system is pulled up by the mechanism via 
cylinders and robot can move faster. In other case; if the 
environment has greater slope angle and ground is muddy 
soil, in addition to wheels pallet system is added to motion 
for more traction to prevent sliding and spinning. 
 
The designed robot has ability to enter the fire zone that 
has vital importance for firefighting operations. In some fire 
scenarios that is almost impossible to reach to flame from 
distance. So fireman try to come close to fire zone and that 
may cause to injuries and loss of lives. To handle these 
problems; body of the robot was designed to resist fire up to 
30 minutes and 1400 °C without any fault. Body shell 
combination of the robot can protect the components such as 
batteries, electric motors, drivers, cables and etc. from fire.  
In this time period the fireman can enter the robot and wait 
for the help safely. This feature of the robot is tested with 
experimental applications in the future works. With the 
additional features explained above the designed firefighting 
robot is expected to be stronger, faster, more technological 
and efficient for firefighting operations.

B. Material of Firefighting Robot 
Since the synthesis of the boron nitride in its cubic 
crystallographic structure, Cubic Boron Nitride (cBN) is a 
material that has exceptionally high hardness and special 
properties. For practical use, cBN is, after diamond, the 
second known hardest material and is today being increasingly 
used as cutting and drilling tools in substitution for diamond 
based tools owing to superior thermal stability and chemical 
inertness. Contrary to diamond, its structure is stable up to 
2,000 °C. In addition, the decrease in the hardness of diamond 
is accentuated beyond 500 °C becoming inferior to that of 
cBN at 800 °C and above. Furthermore, it was realized that 
cBN stayed inert in contact with steels, cast irons, and super 
alloys at operational conditions for which diamond would 
react and loose machinability [8].  
Silica aerogels have high porosity, extremely low density 
solids composed of interconnected particles that form an open 
nanostructure. As a result of the low thermal conductivity of 
silica and nanometer pore sizes the thermal conductivity of 
silica aerogel is very low. Low thermal conductivity and 
optical properties make silica aerogels desirable for insulating 
applications such as cover layers for windows and solar 
collectors. The properties of aerogels that make them such 
good insulators also make them inherently fragile and brittle 
[9]. 
AISI 1018 mild/low carbon steel has excellent weldability 
and produces a uniform and harder case and it is considered as 
the best steel for carburized parts. AISI 1018 mild/low carbon 
steel offers a good balance of toughness, strength and 
ductility. Provided with higher mechanical properties, AISI 
1018 hot rolled steel also includes improved machining 
characteristics and Brinell hardness. Specific manufacturing 
controls are used for surface preparation, chemical 
composition, rolling and heating processes. All these 
processes develop a supreme quality product that are suited to 
fabrication processes such as welding, forging, drilling, 
machining, cold drawing and heat treating. 
Robot shell was consisted of using; galvanized steel with 
the thickness of 5 mm as the main plate, 5 µm cubic boron 
nitride coating for non-flammability and  50 mm silica aerogel 
for  thermal insulation. AISI 1018 steel was selected as chassis 
frame material. The mechanical and thermal properties of 
AISI 1018 steel, silica aerogel and galvanized steel and cubic 
boron nitride are given in Table I.

III. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS 
In order to determine the structural behavior of firefighting 
robot on the model characteristic static analysis was carried 
out using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). This approach 
increased the design process progress and efficiency [10, 11]. 
The force applied chassis area was about 0.7 m2. 750, 1,000 
and 2,000 kg forces were applied to chassis. Therefore; 
structural analysis was executed with 10, 14 and 28 kPa 
pressures forces and standard earth gravity. 
Structural 
analysis 
was 
conducted 
using 
Ansys 
Workbench Static Structural Module. Safety factors, 
maximum equivalent stresses and strains for whole chassis 
frame were calculated. 
The parameters obtained from design environment such as 
dimensions, component weights etc. were used as input for 
analysis. The material of the chassis was defined as AISI 1018 
also known as structural steel. Before the computation, the 
model was simplified to increase the analysis speed and 
computation precision. The finite element model of the robot 
arm was composed of 86,619 nodes and 17,988 elements. 
Mesh view of the chassis is shown in Figure 2.

IV. THERMAL COMPUTATIONS AND ANALYSIS 
Thermal calculations and analysis were carried out for 
specified 1x1 m2 section area of robot shell combination. Heat 
transfer was occurred from fire ambient to shell with 
convection and radiation. The temperature gradient of fire was 
derived using required logarithmic function (1) [12].  
𝑇= 345 𝑙𝑜𝑔10 (8𝑡 +  1) +  20                                          (1) 
Heat transfer from fire ambient to interior surface was 
calculated using (2). 
𝑄(𝑡) =
𝑇∞1−𝑇∞2
𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙                                                              (2) 
In where; “T∞1” represents the temperature gradient of fire, 
“T∞2” is temperature of inside air. “Rtotal” total thermal 
resistivity of all system was calculated using thermal 
resistivity all of the elements (3).

“L” use as thickness of layers, “k” represents the thermal 
conductivity of selected shell material. As fire behaves as an 
infinite thermal energy source for specified time interval and 
ambient temperature assumed as constant, Steady State 
solution method was applied. 
The numeric calculations and analysis were carried out for 
30, 300, 900 and 1,800 seconds time intervals. The 
temperature variation of the fire ambient, inside area and 
insulation properties of the combined shell material were 
obtained from calculations and analysis (Figure 3).

The total calculated displacements for 750, 1,000 and 
2,000 kg were about 0.08, 0.1 and 0.2 mm, respectively. 
According to Mott’s recommendation for machine member’s 
deflection ranges (from 0.0005 to 0.003 m/m) [13] 
displacements are within allowable limits. Maximum stresses 
are not overcame the yield of the material. It can be 
understood from the structural analysis that AISI 1018 
material can be used as chassis frame material for firefighting 
robot. The factor of safety also indicates that selected chassis 
material is 5 times stronger for the intended loads.

B. Thermal Calculations and Analysis 
The calculated temperature gradient of fire according to 
time is shown in Figure 4. As understood from the figure that 
fire temperature increased extremely fast and reached almost 
850 °C level in first 30 second period and affected the 
ambient and robot chassis significantly. After 30 seconds fire 
temperature increased slower when compared with the first 
period. Therefore; first time zone between 0-30 seconds is 
most critical for insulation and non-flammability.  
 
Inside area temperature distribution of firefighting robot 
with numerical calculations using Matlab for 30 seconds and 
1,800 seconds time periods is shown in Figure 5. Inside area 
of the robot was only 32.8 °C while the ambient temperature 
that affects the robot’s exterior wall was about 850 °C in 30 s 
time period. The similar scenario was obtained from 1,800 
seconds calculations.  
 
Although; ambient temperature reached the 1,450 °C the 
inside area temperature increased only 2 °C from 30 to 1,800 
seconds time period. These results showed that shell material 
combination of firefighting robot can provide extremely great 
insulation and (about %98) and non-flammability feature.

Similar results with numeric calculations were obtained from 
analysis. Inside area temperatures were found as 32.5 and 
33.5 °C respectively for 30 and 1,800 seconds time periods. 
When the results of numerical solutions and analysis were 
compared, negligible errors (about ± 1 °C) were observed 
caused from decimal differences. The results of the analysis 
are summarized in Table III.

VI. CONCLUSION 
 In this study, firefighting robot especially for forest fires was 
analyzed using Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) 
methods. Structural and thermal analyses were carried out 
after the frame and shell design of the robot body and material 
selection. Occurred stress, strain, displacement and safety 
factor values were computed with structural analysis using 
FEA methods. A heat-insulating and fireproof plate was 
build. Robot shell was composed with three parts using; 
galvanized steel as the main plate, cubic boron nitride coating 
for non-flammability and silica aerogel for thermal 
insulation. Thermal insulation calculations and analysis were 
conducted using Matlab and Ansys Workbench Steady State 
Thermal tools. The numeric calculations and analysis were 
carried out for 30, 300, 900 and 1,800 seconds time intervals. 
The temperature variation of the ambient and inside area 
temperatures and insulation properties of the combined shell 
material were obtained from calculations and analysis. The 
results were compared. Structural analysis showed that the 
yield strength of the selected material for chassis (AISI 1018) 
was five times more than occurred maximum stress with 
2,000 kg forces. It can be concluded that designed and 
combined shell material provided extremely great insulation 
(about %98) that has vital importance for firefighting.
