M.  \\n \\n \\n \\nAbstract:  \\nSoutheast  Nigeria  lacks  and needs  an up-to-date fire service  station.  The impression  and the general \\nattitude  of the public  towards  the services  provided  by the fire service  agency  are discouraging.  People \\nare still living  in the past and without  the knowledge  of what  the services  of the agency  are. They  are \\nused to seeing  old and abandoned  fire stations  and fire apparatus  without  knowing  what  they are used \\nfor hence,  the need for education  and awareness  of the services  of the agenc y. The primary  aim of this \\nstudy  is to bring  to the attention  of Enugu  State,  Federal  Government  of Nigeria  and the people  of the \\nsoutheast  region  that, there  is no Regional  Fire Service  and Fighting  Station  in the region.  This study \\ninvestigated inadequate fire service and fighting stations in southeast, Nigeria and the architectural \\nsolutions  and policies  to ameliorate  the problems. The  disciplinary  focus  area of this study  is \\narchitecture as such; content base analysis was used and looked into previous studies done in the \\nsubject  matter  by different  authors.  Enugu,  in Enugu  State,  has a fire service  station  located  along  Ogui \\nRoad  opposite  the NIPOST  and built in the 1960's  by the colonial  masters.  It was the first fire service \\nstation built by the colonial master which served the old eastern region and till date, it is still in its \\noriginal  state without  modifications.  The need  for a modern  day fire station  in an area is a necessity  and \\nnot to be negotiated  because  of the services  they provide.  A regional  fire fighting  station  is needed  in a \\nregion  in order  to provide  fire fighting  services,  safety  operations,  improved  health  and wellness  of the \\nfire fighting  personnel  in that region.  This paper  recommends  creating  an inclusive  environment  for the \\nstaff, where  they would  have  the opportunity  to meet  people  from  the communit y, exercise  themselves \\nand have  the privilege  of working  in an environment  with an eating  establishment.  \\n \\nKey words:  Enugu,  population,  congestion,  fire outbreak,  architecture,  fire fighting  \\n \\n \\n \\nIntroduction  \\nFrom  the earliest time, the  fire that empowered \\nman to cook food, ward o ff animals, fo rge tools \\nand also enabled him to survive intense cold has \\nalso been  an everlasting  hazard  to him. The history \\nof occupational fire hazard causing significant \\ndamage  is  very  old.  The  Great  Fire  of  Rome \\n(67CE)  started  in the shops  of merchants  who sold \\nflammable  goods  near the Circus  Maximus,  while \\nthe Great  Fire of London  (1666CE)  was started  in a \\nbaker y, within  a merchant's  district  that held oil, pitch, ta r, coal, tallo w, fats, suga r, alcohol, \\nturpentine,  and gunpowde r. As with the other \\ncases,  the Great  Fire of London  led to situations \\nthat were previously acceptable being re - \\nclassified as hazardous (Kodur et al., 2019). \\nFire hazard in buildings can be defined as the \\npotential of accidental or intentional fire to \\nthreaten  life, structural,  and property  safety  in a \\nbuilding. Fire hazard constitute of all factors \\npresent in a building that can cause ignition, \\naggravate fire severit y, incapacitate building \\nfire safety  provisions,  and hinder  escape  or fire \\nfighting  operations.\\n \\n                                                                           36   \\nDepartment of  Architecture, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Nnamdi  Azikiwe Universit y, Awka,  Anambra State, \\nNigeria\", 'Tropical Built Environment Journal (TBEJ) Vol. 8, No. 1, 2021   \\n \\nBased on available statistics, it is suggested that \\ncooking is the leading cause of fire in both \\nresidential  and non-residential  buildings  (USFA, \\n2016). Other sources of ignition in buildings \\ninclude all  live flames,  heaters  and hot surfaces, \\nelectrical malfunction, fireworks, and arson and \\nvandalis m (Drysdale , 2011). With rapid \\ndevelopment  across  the  globe,  fire  hazard  in \\nb u i l d i n g s   h a v e   u n d e r g o n e   s i g n i f i c a n t \\ntransformation  in terms  of severity  and versatility \\nand have become a  growing  concern in  recent \\nyears  (Brushlinsky  et al., 2017).  \\nAnother source of fire hazard, especially in \\npopulated  areas  close  to wild lands,  is one arising \\nfrom forest fires (wildfires). Due to increase in \\nhuman encroachment on the wild land urban \\ninterface, number of buildings and people living \\nin the fire pron e wild land is increasin g \\nsignificantly  in recent  years. This  has made \\nwildfires,  resulting  primarily from  arson  and \\nlightning, a major source of fire hazard in wild \\nland urban  areas  across  the globe  (Kodur  et al., \\n2019).  In USA alone,  an average  of 66,903 \\nwildfires occurred between 2009 -2018 which \\nburned  an average  of 6.9 million  acres  and caused \\nan average  of US$1.8bn  for fire fighting  costs.  In \\n2018,  a total of  25,790  structures  were  destroyed \\nby wildfires including 18,137 residences, 6,927 \\nminor structures, and 229 commercial/mixed \\nresidential  structures;  which  is highest  number  of \\nstructures lost to wildfires since 1999 and almost \\ndouble of previous highest of 12,306 in 2017 \\n(NICC,  2018).  \\nWhen  man began  to live in villages  and later build \\ncities the possibility of a blaze spreading into a \\nconflagration  increased.  A conflagration  is  an \\nintense, area -wide, disastrous fire characterized \\nby great  sheets  of flame and  cyclonic winds. \\nSevere  updraft  in a conflagration  causes  winds  on \\nthe perimeter  to reach  near hurricane  strength  and \\ncan suck people  into the firestorm  (Arnold,  2005). \\nMany of the conflagrations have occurred as \\nsecondary  events  to natural  disasters,  such as volcanic eruptions, floods, earthquakes that \\nrupture  natural  gas liners,  and lightning  from \\npowerful  thunderstorms.  There  are  man- \\nm a d e   i g n i t i o n s   a s   w e l l ,   i n c l u d i n g \\ncarelessness with open flames and smoking \\nmaterials  (Krame r, 2009). The  deadliest \\nsingle  location  fire in the world,  which  killed  \\n1,700 people, was a 1949 conflagration at a \\nChungking , Chin a riverfron t comple x \\n(Arnold, 2005). Some conflagrations had \\nbeen  deliberately  set by incendiary  bombing \\nof cities,  including  Coventry  (800 killed)  and \\nLondon (1,500 killed), England; Hambu rg \\n(100,000  killed)  and Dresden  (300,000 \\nkilled) ,   Germany ;   and   Tokyo ,   Japa n \\n( 1 8 5 , 0 0 0   k i l l e d ) .      S o m e   o f   t h e s e \\nconflagrations  were  so severe,  people  on the \\noutskirts  died from  oxygen  starvation  as 125 \\nto 150 mph winds fed the firestorms and \\nvacuumed air from their lungs.   These \\nintense fires will explode buildings as they \\napproach, due to the air pressure di fference \\nbetween the interior and exterior of the \\nbuilding, and usually burn all buildings in a \\ncity down to the brick walls, with no steel \\nremaining  (Arnold,  2005).  \\nFire is the rapid  oxidation  of a material  in the \\nexothermic  chemical  process  of combustion, \\nreleasing heat, light and various reaction \\nproducts.  At a certain  point  in the combustion \\nreaction  called  the ignition  point,  flames  are \\nproduced.  The flame  is the visible  portion  of \\nfire (Fire  Histor y, 2014). The  risk of fire is \\none of the greatest threats to health and \\nsafet y, property  and the delivery  of essential \\nservices in any communit y. Fire outbreaks \\nusually occurs accidentall y, deliberately or \\nout of carelessness,  and when  it occurs  it can \\ndevastate,  terrorize  and damage  lives as well \\nas propert y. It could  equally  contribute  to the \\ndecline in socio -economic and physical \\ndevelopment  of a societ y. The earliest  known \\nfire fighting service was formed in ancient \\nRome by Marcus Ignatius Rufus who used \\nhis slaves  to provide  a free fire service.\\n \\n \\n                                                                            37  ', \"Fire Outb reaks in the Southeast Nigeria  And Inadequacies In Service  And Fighting Stations.   \\n \\nThese men fought fires using bucket chains and \\nalso patrolled the streets with  the authority to \\nimpose corporal punishment upon those who \\nviolated  fire prevention  codes. The  emperor \\nAugustus  established  a public  fire department  in \\n24 BCE, comprising 600 slaves distributed \\namongst  seven  fire stations  in Rome  (Cote  et. al, \\n1988).  \\nToday,  in  Nigeria,  buckets  are  still  in  use  in \\nf i g h t i n g   f i r e   o u t b r e a k s   e v e n   w i t h   t h e \\nestablishment  of the fire stations  mostly  before  \\n1960 and after the Nigerian independence.  Fire \\nhouses  or stations  are houses  designed  and built to \\naccommodate several fire fighting apparatus and \\nequipment  and provide  adequate  and fast response \\nto emergencie s in fire extinguishing , safe \\nguarding human as well as  properties. Properly \\ndesigned fire houses, especially la rge ones, \\nprovid e facilitie s for training , maintenance , \\nsuppl y, prevention  and protection. A  fire station \\nsupports the needs of the fire department and the \\ncommunity in which it is located. It must \\naccommodat e extremel y divers e functions , \\nincluding housing, recreation, administration, \\ntraining, community education, equipment and \\nvehicl e storage , equipmen t and vehicl e \\nmaintenance, and hazardous materials storage. \\nWhile it  is usually  only occupied by  trained \\npersonnel , the facilit y may also need to \\naccommodate the  general  public  for community \\neducation  or outreach  programs  (Mion,  2017).  \\nIn Nigeria,  fire fighting  started  in 1901,  during  the \\ncolonial era. It was an arm of the Nigerian police \\nand the fire station then which was the first and \\nlocated  at Tinubus,  square  in Lagos  State  (Njoku \\nand Itu, 2016).  The Lagos Fire Brigade, as it was \\ncalled, was a formation of Nigerian police forces \\nwhich  started  with the station  as part of the central \\npolice  force  building. The  fire service  was then \\nknown as Police Fire, all fires which threatened \\nlife and property (police ordinance, chapter 176, \\nsection  47). The first set of fire stations  were  built \\nin 1945  at Savage  Street,  Ebute -meta  and Marine  Beach,  Apapa to serve the then Lagos territor y. \\nSince  then,  the number  of fire stations  has been \\non the increase  (Ugwu,  2010).  The fire stations \\nthen were  commercial in  nature  and had no \\nautonom y. They  gained  autonomy  and became  a \\ngovernment parastatal and immediately were \\nseparated  from  the police  force  in 1964  forming \\nthe Federal Fire Service (Njoku, 2012). Not \\nlater than three months after they gained \\nautonom y, police  officers  who were  members  of \\nthe Police Fire Brigade established under the \\nprovisions  of the Police Act were  transferred, \\nunder the approval of the Fire Commissione r, \\nand with the consent of the Inspector General, \\nthe Police  Service  Commission  and the Federal \\nCivil Service Commission from the Nigeria \\nPolice Force to the Federal Fire Service (Fire \\nService  Act, 1964).  \\n \\nThe Federal  Fire Service  was established  in \\n1901 by the British colonial regime as a unit \\nwithin  the Lagos  Police  Service  Department,  to \\nprevent  and combat  fire outbreak  in the \\ngovernment reserved areas of Lagos colon y. \\nThe unit was formed  and incorporated  alongside \\nthe then Lagos police and was known as the \\nLagos  Police  Fire Brigade. The  Lagos  Police \\nFire Brigade  was thus an apparatus  of the British \\ncolonia l government . Its leadershi p and \\nadministration  rested  squarely  on the colonists. \\nThe agency  essentially  developed  along  the line \\nof protecting  the colonial  regime's  interests  and \\ninfrastructure. It became Federal Fire Service \\nby an act of parliament  in 1964  known  as The \\nFire Service  Act of 1964.  All the offices  and men \\nserving in the agency were transferred to the \\nFederal  Ministry  of Internal  Affairs as officers \\nand men of the Federal  Fire Service. The \\nFederal  Fire Service  therefore,  became  a \\nparamilitary  organisation,  under  the supervision \\nof the Minister of the Federal Ministry of \\nInterio r, with the Controller  General  as its head \\n(Federal  Fire Service  Portal,  2020).\\n \\n \\n39\", 'Tropical Built Environment Journal (TBEJ) Vol. 8, No. 1, 2021   \\n \\nSince the establishment of the fire service by the \\nFire Service Act  (law)  of 1964,  it has not been \\nreviewed.  Fire Service  today  in Nigeria  is still the \\nonly statutory o rganization established by  a law \\nmandate d with the sole responsibilit y of \\nmitigation, prevention and  extinction of  fire and \\nother eme rgencies as well as performs other \\nsundr y duties . Thes e service s includ e fire \\nfighting, fire prevention, search and rescue \\nservices,  humanitarian  services  etc. Increments  in \\np o p u l a t i o n   a n d   u r b a n i z a t i o n ,   w i t h   n o \\ncommensurate improvement and  expansion  in \\npublic infrastructure, have in no small measure \\ncontributed  to the increase  in fire incidents  and the states in Nigeria have no dependable water \\nsupply and do not have the capacity to provide \\nand maintain bore holes for  their water suppl y. \\nThese fire stations, not only that they are in \\ndisrepai r, they do not have adequate water to \\nfight fire in their communities.  \\nNigeria  is made  up of thirty -six states. All  the \\nstates  in Nigeria  are grouped  according to \\nregions,  and with six di fferent geopolitical \\nzones;  North  Central,  North  East,  North West, \\nSouth  East,  South  South,  South  West (Olawale,  \\n2018).  These  zones  are the key construction  to \\nNigeria.  This system  of geopolitical  zones  and\\nfire  related  fatalities  (Oserogho,  2018) . The states  under  them  was adopted  under  the regime\\nfederal and various state governments have Fire \\nService  Laws.  Common  to both federal  and states \\nFire Service Laws are the establishment of the \\nFire Servic e Department s whos e principa l \\nstatutory  responsibility  is to facilitate  all fire- \\nfighting and fire -prevention activities in their \\njurisdictions.  Some  of the fire-fighting activities \\nenvisaged by  statutes include the  prevention, \\ncontrol and extinguishment of any kind of fire. \\nOthers are the saving and protection of lives and \\nproperties ; and other humanitaria n service s \\nrelated  to fire prevention  and control. The  Fire \\nService Laws also require each Fire Service \\nDepartment to make e fficient arrangements for \\nthe fire service  to manage  distress  calls for fire or \\nother eme rgency assistance whenever the need \\narises (Oserogho, 2018) . In line with meeting up \\nwith these demands, both the Federal, all thirty - \\nsix (36) sta tes of the federation and the federal \\ncapital territory have  their own fire service \\nestablished  to tackle fire  and related disaster \\nwithin  their locality  (Agbili,  2013),  but that seem \\nnot to be the case in Nigeria.  The fire stations  and \\ntheir apparatus in almost all the states of the \\nfederatio n are in total disrepai r and need \\nimmediate  attention.

Enugu, \\nbeing  and assumed  to be the regional  centre  for the \\nsoutheast  had one fire service  station  and it is not \\nfunctional.  The increasing  rate of fire outbreaks  in \\nEnugu  State  due to population,  congestion,  poor \\nplanning  and waste  over the years,  has become  an \\nissue  especiall y, in cases  where  there  were  no \\nquick   respons e   from   the   fire   department . \\nGovernment  records  indicate  that the last time three fire service stations located at Ogui, \\nEnugu North local government area, Nsukka, \\nNsukka  LGA  and Idaw  river, Enugu  South  LGA \\nwere  built in 1962,  when  Enugu  State  was under \\nthe defunct  Eastern  Region  (Premium  Times,  \\n2018). Part of the problems with the existing \\nfire stations are primarily infrastructural and \\nlack maintenance, su ffer from abandonment, \\nlack of interest on the part of the government. \\nModern  equipment used  in fighting  the fire \\noutbreaks were lacking, as well as, inadequate \\nstaffing.

Their  foremost  interest \\nwas on salaries and  work  conveniences  and the \\ncollapsing infrastructure, although these were \\nequall y important . Howeve r, upon furthe r \\ninvestigation, the researchers noticed that the \\nmajor equipment needed in a fire service \\nstations  were  conspicuously  missing.  According \\nto the Importance of fire service (2017), safety \\nagainst Fire is a very important thing at work \\nplaces as well as at homes. Every yea r, large \\nnumbers of people die due to Fire. Fire safety \\ncan easily be ensured by having Fire Fighting \\nEquipment  and proper  Fire Protection. The \\nImportance of Fire fighting Equipment cannot \\nbe over stretched as they ensure maximum \\nprotection  against  Fire. The  Fire Fighting \\nEquipment also ensures safety of the fire \\nfighters themselves who  risk their lives to  save \\nothers.  There  are many  and different  types  of fire \\nfighting equipment available to the fire fighte r. \\nSome  major  ones are: \\n \\nThe Fi re Extinguisher â Fire Extinguisher is \\nthe primar y need of any smal l or big \\nestablishment .

The  Fire Alarms  alert in \\ncases  of Fire and the loud Fire Alarm  directs \\npeople  to the exact  place  where  the Fire occurs.  \\n \\nFire fighting Blankets â Fire fighting Blankets \\nare really helpful in preventing the fire from \\nspreading.

As noted  in the Importance \\nof Fire Protection in Buildings (2018), fire \\nsafety is of the highest importance in any \\nbuilding,  to ensure  safety  of the employees  and \\nthe protection of  the building.  Fire protection \\nsystems  and procedures  are a legal  requirement \\nand need  to be put in place  in buildings  to make \\nemployees  aware  in the event  of a fire and they \\nshould understand that, fire safety is of the \\nhighest  importance in  any building, to  ensure \\ntheir safety and the protection of the buildings. \\nBuildings  must  comply  with The  Regulatory \\nRequirements of Fire Safet y, which applies to \\ngeneral fire safety across the bo ard and both \\nresidential and work premises are required to \\nprovide  minimum  fire safety  standards,  with\\n \\n \\n42', \"Tropical Built Environment Journal (TBEJ) Vol. 8, No. 1, 2021   \\n \\nindividuals having the responsibility to  carry out \\nrisk assessments to identif y, manage and reduce \\nthe risk of fire. \\n \\nTo comply  with the Fire Safety  Orde r, firstly  a fire \\nrisk assessment  must  always  be carried  out by the \\nperson  responsible. This  is where  employees  are \\nprovided with the adequate fire safety training, in \\norder  to carry  out the correct  procedures  in case of \\nan emergenc y. It's crucial  that fire detection and \\nsuppressio n system s are alway s completel y \\nfunctional, including ensuring the appropriate \\nequipmen t is properl y installed , teste d and \\nmaintained  for safe use in the event  of a fire. A fire \\nalarm detection system is designed to sense \\nsmoke, extreme heat or fire and provide a high \\nfrequenc y alert to personne l throughou t a \\nbuilding. Fire alarms need to be installed in \\ncentralized  areas  and should  also be installed  in the \\nhead  of stairways  on every  floor  of a multi -storey \\nstructure. The  detection  systems  can be activated \\nautomatically or  manuall y, via call points  on the \\nwall. It is vital these systems are installed and \\noperate  effectivel y, to protect  life from  the danger \\nof a fire. A fire  suppression  system  is used to \\nprevent  and extinguish  fire in a building,  using  dry \\nchemicals  or wet agents. The  types  of systems \\ninclude,  inert gases,  Co2 and water  mist.  \\n \\nThe chemical agent is released after the fire \\nsuppression  system detects smoke and raises an \\nalarm. The  sounders  are the final warning  before \\nthe agent is released. Fire extinguishers play a \\ncrucial role in protecting buildings, by fighting \\nfires in their early stages. Located in easily \\naccessible  spots,  fire extinguishers  can be used by \\nanyone  to eliminate  fires,  using  chemicals  such as, \\nwate r, powde r, foam,  Co2 and wet chemical.  \\n \\nFire safety signs provide clear guidance to mark \\nthe location of  equipment, fire  alarm activation \\npoints, warning signs and fire exits.Through \\nimagery and text, employees are aware of where \\nthey can find the correct  equipment  in case of an emergenc y. Every business needs specially \\ntrained individuals who ensure safe evacuation \\nof everyone  on the premises  in a fire emergenc y. \\nThese are called fire marshals or fire wardens. \\nDepending  on the business  and size, more than \\none fire marshal  may be needed  (Importance  of \\nfire protection  in buildings,  2018).  \\n \\nConclusion  \\nFire station  in an area is a necessity  and not to be \\nnegotiated  because  of the services  they provide. \\nA fire station  is a facility  or structure  for storing \\nfire fighting apparatus such  as fire fighting \\nequipment , vehicles , personne l protectiv e \\nequipment and so many others. In most cases, \\nthey have working and living space for the fire \\nfighters  and support  staff. These  are primarily \\nimportant  for every  community  to have. The \\npersonnel of the fire stations prevent fires and \\nprotect  buildings,  attend  to accidents  in accident \\nsites and save lives. House,  industrial and \\naccident  fires kill and injure  thousands  of people \\nyearly  and at the same  time,  cost a lot of people \\ntheir valued  possessions  and memories. Not \\nonly that fire stations are needed in every \\ncommunit y, regional fire stations are equally \\nimportant  because,  they are the places  where  the \\nstaff of the community fire  stations  are trained \\nand seminars  conducted.  In order  to provide  safe \\noperations  and improved  health  and wellness  of \\nthe fire fighting personnel in the region, a \\nregional  fire fighting  station  will be needed.  \\nA regional  fire fighting  station  is needed  in a \\nregion in order to provide safe operations and \\nimproved  health  and wellness  of the fire fighting \\npersonnel  in that region. This  facility  will not \\nonly provide  facilities  for equipment  and \\napparatus storage, but would provide working \\nand living  space  for the fire fighters  and support \\nstaff. Staying and working in a fire fighting \\nstation  is not only boring  according  to most  staff \\nof the fire fighting stations in  South  East \\nNigeria,  but also treacherous  to their lives.\\n \\n \\n                                                                            43  \", '                              Fire Outb reaks in the Southeast  Nigeria  And Inadequacies  In Service  And Fighting  Stations.     \\n \\n \\n \\nTo avoid  these  situations,  this paper  recommends \\ncreating an inclusive environment for the sta ff, \\nwhere they would  have the opportunity to meet \\npeople from the communit y, exercise themselves \\nand have the privileg e of workin g in an \\nenvironment  with an eating  establishment.  \\n \\n \\n \\nREFERENCES  \\n \\nAgbili  M.

      "~FIRE OUTBREAKS IN  THE SOUTHEAST  NIGERIA  AND INADEQUACIES IN~ SERVICE  AND FIGHTING S TATIONS~Onwume re, Basilia O.; Ihekuna, Chinonye Prisca; Johnson, Jessica Ogechi; Obiadi, Bons and~ Onuorah I. M.~Abstract:~Southeast  Nigeria  lacks  and needs  an up-to-date fire service  station.  The impression  and the general attitude  of the public  towards  the services  provided  by the fire service  agency  are discouraging.  People are still living  in the past and without  the knowledge  of what  the services  of the agency  are. They  are used to seeing  old and abandoned  fire stations  and fire apparatus  without  knowing  what  they are used for hence,  the need for education  and awareness  of the services  of the agenc y. The primary  aim of this study  is to bring  to the attention  of Enugu  State,  Federal  Government  of Nigeria  and the people  of the southeast  region  that, there  is no Regional  Fire Service  and Fighting  Station  in the region.  This study investigated inadequate fire service and fighting stations in southeast, Nigeria and the architectural solutions  and policies  to ameliorate  the problems. The  disciplinary  focus  area of this study  is architecture as such; content base analysis was used and looked into previous studies done in the subject  matter  by different  authors.  Enugu,  in Enugu  State,  has a fire service  station  located  along  Ogui~Road  opposite  the NIPOST  and built in the 1960's  by the colonial  masters.  It was the first fire service station built by the colonial master which served the old eastern region and till date, it is still in its original  state without  modifications.  The need  for a modern  day fire station  in an area is a necessity  and not to be negotiated  because  of the services  they provide.  A regional  fire fighting  station  is needed  in a region  in order  to provide  fire fighting  services,  safety  operations,  improved  health  and wellness  of the fire fighting  personnel  in that region.  This paper  recommends  creating  an inclusive  environment  for the staff, where  they would  have  the opportunity  to meet  people  from  the communit y, exercise  themselves and have  the privilege  of working  in an environment  with an eating  establishment.~Key words:  Enugu,  population,  congestion,  fire outbreak,  architecture,  fire fighting~Introduction~From  the earliest time, the  fire that empowered man to cook food, ward o ff animals, fo rge tools and also enabled him to survive intense cold has also been  an everlasting  hazard  to him. The history of occupational fire hazard causing significant damage  is  very  old.  The  Great  Fire  of  Rome~(67CE)  started  in the shops  of merchants  who sold flammable  goods  near the Circus  Maximus,  while the Great  Fire of London  (1666CE)  was started  in a baker y, within  a merchant's  district  that held oil, pitch, ta r, coal, tallo w, fats, suga r, alcohol,~turpentine,  and gunpowde r. As with the other cases,  the Great  Fire of London  led to situations that were previously acceptable being re -~classified as hazardous (Kodur et al., 2019)~Fire hazard in buildings can be defined as the potential of accidental or intentional fire to threaten  life, structural,  and property  safety  in a building. Fire hazard constitute of all factors present in a building that can cause ignition,~aggravate fire severit y, incapacitate building fire safety  provisions,  and hinder  escape  or fire fighting  operations.~36~Department of  Architecture, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Nnamdi  Azikiwe Universit y, Awka,  Anambra State,~NigeriaTropical Built Environment Journal (TBEJ) Vol. 8, No. 1, 2021~ Based on available statistics, it is suggested that cooking is the leading cause of fire in both residential  and non-residential  buildings  (USFA,~2016). Other sources of ignition in buildings include all  live flames,  heaters  and hot surfaces,~electrical malfunction, fireworks, and arson and vandalis m (Drysdale , 2011). With rapid development  across  the  globe,  fire  hazard  in b u i l d i n g s   h a v e   u n d e r g o n e   s i g n i f i c a n t transformation  in terms  of severity  and versatility and have become a  growing  concern in  recent years  (Brushlinsky  et al., 2017)~Another source of fire hazard, especially in populated  areas  close  to wild lands,  is one arising from forest fires (wildfires). Due to increase in human encroachment on the wild land urban interface, number of buildings and people living in the fire pron e wild land is increasin g significantly  in recent  years. This  has made wildfires,  resulting  primarily from  arson  and lightning, a major source of fire hazard in wild land urban  areas  across  the globe  (Kodur  et al.,~2019).  In USA alone,  an average  of 66,903 wildfires occurred between 2009 -2018 which burned  an average  of 6.9 million  acres  and caused an average  of US$1.8bn  for fire fighting  costs.  In~2018,  a total of  25,790  structures  were  destroyed by wildfires including 18,137 residences, 6,927 minor structures, and 229 commercial/mixed residential  structures;  which  is highest  number  of structures lost to wildfires since 1999 and almost double of previous highest of 12,306 in 2017~(NICC,  2018)~When  man began  to live in villages  and later build cities the possibility of a blaze spreading into a conflagration  increased.  A conflagration  is  an intense, area -wide, disastrous fire characterized by great  sheets  of flame and  cyclonic winds~Severe  updraft  in a conflagration  causes  winds  on the perimeter  to reach  near hurricane  strength  and can suck people  into the firestorm  (Arnold,  2005)~Many of the conflagrations have occurred as secondary  events  to natural  disasters,  such as volcanic eruptions, floods, earthquakes that rupture  natural  gas liners,  and lightning  from powerful  thunderstorms.  There  are  man-~m a d e   i g n i t i o n s   a s   w e l l ,   i n c l u d i n g carelessness with open flames and smoking materials  (Krame r, 2009). The  deadliest single  location  fire in the world,  which  killed~1,700 people, was a 1949 conflagration at a~ Chungking , Chin a riverfron t comple x~(Arnold, 2005). Some conflagrations had been  deliberately  set by incendiary  bombing of cities,  including  Coventry  (800 killed)  and~London (1,500 killed), England; Hambu rg~(100,000  killed)  and Dresden  (300,000 killed) ,   Germany ;   and   Tokyo ,   Japa n~( 1 8 5 , 0 0 0   k i l l e d ) .      S o m e   o f   t h e s e conflagrations  were  so severe,  people  on the outskirts  died from  oxygen  starvation  as 125 to 150 mph winds fed the firestorms and vacuumed air from their lungs.   These intense fires will explode buildings as they approach, due to the air pressure di fference between the interior and exterior of the building, and usually burn all buildings in a city down to the brick walls, with no steel remaining  (Arnold,  2005)~Fire is the rapid  oxidation  of a material  in the exothermic  chemical  process  of combustion,~releasing heat, light and various reaction products.  At a certain  point  in the combustion reaction  called  the ignition  point,  flames  are produced.  The flame  is the visible  portion  of fire (Fire  Histor y, 2014). The  risk of fire is one of the greatest threats to health and safet y, property  and the delivery  of essential services in any communit y. Fire outbreaks usually occurs accidentall y, deliberately or out of carelessness,  and when  it occurs  it can devastate,  terrorize  and damage  lives as well as propert y. It could  equally  contribute  to the decline in socio -economic and physical development  of a societ y. The earliest  known fire fighting service was formed in ancient~Rome by Marcus Ignatius Rufus who used his slaves  to provide  a free fire service.~37  Fire Outb reaks in the Southeast Nigeria  And Inadequacies In Service  And Fighting Stations.~These men fought fires using bucket chains and also patrolled the streets with  the authority to impose corporal punishment upon those who violated  fire prevention  codes. The  emperor~Augustus  established  a public  fire department  in~24 BCE, comprising 600 slaves distributed amongst  seven  fire stations  in Rome  (Cote  et. al,~1988)~Today,  in  Nigeria,  buckets  are  still  in  use  in f i g h t i n g   f i r e   o u t b r e a k s   e v e n   w i t h   t h e establishment  of the fire stations  mostly  before~1960 and after the Nigerian independence.  Fire houses  or stations  are houses  designed  and built to accommodate several fire fighting apparatus and equipment  and provide  adequate  and fast response to emergencie s in fire extinguishing , safe guarding human as well as  properties. Properly designed fire houses, especially la rge ones,~provid e facilitie s for training , maintenance ,~suppl y, prevention  and protection. A  fire station supports the needs of the fire department and the community in which it is located. It must accommodat e extremel y divers e functions ,~including housing, recreation, administration,~training, community education, equipment and vehicl e storage , equipmen t and vehicl e maintenance, and hazardous materials storage~While it  is usually  only occupied by  trained personnel , the facilit y may also need to accommodate the  general  public  for community education  or outreach  programs  (Mion,  2017)~In Nigeria,  fire fighting  started  in 1901,  during  the colonial era. It was an arm of the Nigerian police and the fire station then which was the first and located  at Tinubus,  square  in Lagos  State  (Njoku and Itu, 2016).  The Lagos Fire Brigade, as it was called, was a formation of Nigerian police forces which  started  with the station  as part of the central police  force  building. The  fire service  was then known as Police Fire, all fires which threatened life and property (police ordinance, chapter 176,~section  47). The first set of fire stations  were  built in 1945  at Savage  Street,  Ebute -meta  and Marine  Beach,  Apapa to serve the then Lagos territor y~Since  then,  the number  of fire stations  has been on the increase  (Ugwu,  2010).  The fire stations then were  commercial in  nature  and had no autonom y. They  gained  autonomy  and became  a government parastatal and immediately were separated  from  the police  force  in 1964  forming the Federal Fire Service (Njoku, 2012). Not later than three months after they gained autonom y, police  officers  who were  members  of the Police Fire Brigade established under the provisions  of the Police Act were  transferred,~under the approval of the Fire Commissione r,~and with the consent of the Inspector General,~the Police  Service  Commission  and the Federal~Civil Service Commission from the Nigeria~Police Force to the Federal Fire Service (Fire~Service  Act, 1964).~The Federal  Fire Service  was established  in~1901 by the British colonial regime as a unit within  the Lagos  Police  Service  Department,  to prevent  and combat  fire outbreak  in the government reserved areas of Lagos colon y~The unit was formed  and incorporated  alongside the then Lagos police and was known as the~ Lagos  Police  Fire Brigade. The  Lagos  Police~Fire Brigade  was thus an apparatus  of the British colonia l government . Its leadershi p and administration  rested  squarely  on the colonists~The agency  essentially  developed  along  the line of protecting  the colonial  regime's  interests  and infrastructure. It became Federal Fire Service by an act of parliament  in 1964  known  as The~ Fire Service  Act of 1964.  All the offices  and men serving in the agency were transferred to the~Federal  Ministry  of Internal  Affairs as officers and men of the Federal  Fire Service. The~ Federal  Fire Service  therefore,  became  a paramilitary  organisation,  under  the supervision of the Minister of the Federal Ministry of~Interio r, with the Controller  General  as its head~(Federal  Fire Service  Portal,  2020).~39Tropical Built Environment Journal (TBEJ) Vol. 8, No. 1, 2021~ Since the establishment of the fire service by the~Fire Service Act  (law)  of 1964,  it has not been reviewed.  Fire Service  today  in Nigeria  is still the only statutory o rganization established by  a law mandate d with the sole responsibilit y of mitigation, prevention and  extinction of  fire and other eme rgencies as well as performs other sundr y duties . Thes e service s includ e fire fighting, fire prevention, search and rescue services,  humanitarian  services  etc. Increments  in p o p u l a t i o n   a n d   u r b a n i z a t i o n ,   w i t h   n o commensurate improvement and  expansion  in public infrastructure, have in no small measure contributed  to the increase  in fire incidents  and the states in Nigeria have no dependable water supply and do not have the capacity to provide and maintain bore holes for  their water suppl y~These fire stations, not only that they are in disrepai r, they do not have adequate water to fight fire in their communities~Nigeria  is made  up of thirty -six states. All  the states  in Nigeria  are grouped  according to regions,  and with six di fferent geopolitical zones;  North  Central,  North  East,  North West,~South  East,  South  South,  South  West (Olawale,~2018).  These  zones  are the key construction  to~ Nigeria.  This system  of geopolitical  zones  and fire  related  fatalities  (Oserogho,  2018) . The states  under  them  was adopted  under  the regime federal and various state governments have Fire~Service  Laws.  Common  to both federal  and states~Fire Service Laws are the establishment of the~ Fire Servic e Department s whos e principa l statutory  responsibility  is to facilitate  all fire-~fighting and fire -prevention activities in their jurisdictions.  Some  of the fire-fighting activities envisaged by  statutes include the  prevention,~control and extinguishment of any kind of fire~Others are the saving and protection of lives and properties ; and other humanitaria n service s related  to fire prevention  and control. The  Fire~Service Laws also require each Fire Service~Department to make e fficient arrangements for the fire service  to manage  distress  calls for fire or other eme rgency assistance whenever the need arises (Oserogho, 2018) . In line with meeting up with these demands, both the Federal, all thirty -~six (36) sta tes of the federation and the federal capital territory have  their own fire service established  to tackle fire  and related disaster within  their locality  (Agbili,  2013),  but that seem not to be the case in Nigeria.  The fire stations  and their apparatus in almost all the states of the federatio n are in total disrepai r and need immediate  attention.  Unfortunatel y, the Water~Cooperation , charged with providin g and supplying water in each of the state are equally collapsing  without  the capacity  to supply  water  to their communities and including the fire service stations  as a result,  almost  all the fire stations  in all of  President  Ibrahim  Babangida.  States  in~ Nigeria  are implemented  into the zones.  Nigeria contains  more  than 400 ethnic groups,  which speak  more  than 450 languages. Therefore,  it`s necessary to keep all people in harmony within these  zones.  The federal  capital  territory  and 36 state s are distribute d betwee n these six geopolitical  zones  in Nigeria. The  zones  are divided according to economic, political and ethnical  preferences  of Nigeria. Yoruba  takes~South -West, Hausa  takes  North -East and North -~West, and South -East is taken  by Igbo. The state s of Nigeri a contai n variou s ethni c populations which are needed to be properly controlled  (Ibenegbu,  2017).  The North  Central~Zone  is made  up of six states:  the Nige r, Benue,~Nassarawa,  Plateau,  Kogi  and Kwara  states.  The~ Federal capital territory is also included in this zone. The  North  Central  Geopolitical  zone  is also referred  as the middle  belt of Nigeria. The top cities in this zone are Lafia, Jos, Minna,~Makurdi,  Lokoja,  Ilorin  and Abuja.  The ethnic groups presented in this zone are Mangu,~Berom , Gbag y, Nupe , Tiv, Mada -Eggon ,~Yoruba,  Igala,  Idoma,  Gwandara  and Idoma.The~North -West geopolitical zone is presented by seven states: the Jagawa, Kano, Katsina, and~ Kaduna,  Kebbi,  Zamfara  and Sokoto  states.  The top cities  of the North -West geopolitical  zone~38  Fire Outb reaks in the Southeast Nigeria  And Inadequacies In Service  And Fighting Stations.~are Gusau,  Dutse,  Birnin -Kebbi,  Katsina,  Kano,~Kaduna,  Zaria,  and  Sokoto.

The South -West geopolitical  zone  is presented  by six states:  the Ekiti,  Ondo,  Osun,~Oyo,  Ogun  and Lagos.  The top cities  of the zone are Ado-Ekiti,  Oshogbo,  Ogbomoso,  Abeokuta,~Akure,  Ibadan  and  Lagos.  The  South -West  is mainly  populated  by Yorubas.  The South -East geopolitical  zone  is presented  by five states:  the~ Abia,  Imo, Ebonyi,  Enugu  and Anambra  States~The  largest  cities  in  the  zone  are  Abakaliki,~Owerri,  Enugu,  Onitsha  and Aba.  The South -East is mainly  populated  by Igbos  (Ibenegbu,  2017)~With the establishment  of the geographic  zones,~the establishment  and building  of the fire stations in the zones  to fight and protect  life and properties were  not adequately  considered.  The ones built before  and after the Nigerian  independence  are in disarray  and  need  structural  attention.  Enugu,~being  and assumed  to be the regional  centre  for the southeast  had one fire service  station  and it is not functional.  The increasing  rate of fire outbreaks  in~ Enugu  State  due to population,  congestion,  poor planning  and waste  over the years,  has become  an issue  especiall y, in cases  where  there  were  no quick   respons e   from   the   fire   department ~Government  records  indicate  that the last time three fire service stations located at Ogui,~Enugu North local government area, Nsukka,~Nsukka  LGA  and Idaw  river, Enugu  South  LGA were  built in 1962,  when  Enugu  State  was under the defunct  Eastern  Region  (Premium  Times,~2018). Part of the problems with the existing fire stations are primarily infrastructural and lack maintenance, su ffer from abandonment,~lack of interest on the part of the government~Modern  equipment used  in fighting  the fire outbreaks were lacking, as well as, inadequate staffing. The public  lacked  the knowledge  as to the benefits  of the agenc y~The impression and the general attitude of the public towards the services provided by the~ Agency  are discouraging.  The people  are still without the knowledge of what the services of the agency  are. People  are used to seeing  old and abandoned fire stations and fire apparatus hence,  the need  for education  and awareness  of the services  of the agenc y. The  problem  is that the impression needs to be changed with the establishment and  design  of an ultra modern facility in the area. Not only that, there is no existin g Federa l Fire Servic e Regiona l~Headquarter in the eastern part of Nigeria,~resulting in the need for one, to st art educating both the government  and the public  on the needs and importance of  the fire fighting agency and their service , communicatio n problem s included.~The study~This study  brings  attention  to the non-existence of Regional  Fire Service  and Fighting  Station  in the South  East zone  of the countr y.

The area of focus is architecture. Content base analysis was used and looked into previous studies done in the subject  matter  by different  authors.~Findings~Enugu, in Enugu State, has a fire service station located along  Ogui  Road  opposite  the NIPOST and built in the 1960's it served the old Eastern~Region  (plate  1).~Plate  1: South  view  of the Enugu  State  Fire Service  Station,~located  along  Ogui  Road~Source;  Onwumere  (Retrieved  March  16th, 2021)~In Imo State,  the state Fire Service  Head  Quarters was built in the Owerri  in 1991  and located  along~ Egbu  Road,  opposite  NIIT  (plate  2).~Plate  2: South  view  of the Owerri,  Imo State  Fire Service~Headquarters~Source;  Onwumere  (Retrieved  March  16th, 2021)  Of all the fire fighting  stations  visited  during  this study  and the interviews  conducted,  not a single personnel  of the fire fighting  stations  mentioned anything about   the educational part of their services to the community nor the equipment needed  for their services.  Their  foremost  interest was on salaries and  work  conveniences  and the collapsing infrastructure, although these were equall y important . Howeve r, upon furthe r investigation, the researchers noticed that the major equipment needed in a fire service stations  were  conspicuously  missing.  According to the Importance of fire service (2017), safety against Fire is a very important thing at work places as well as at homes. Every yea r, large numbers of people die due to Fire. Fire safety can easily be ensured by having Fire Fighting~Equipment  and proper  Fire Protection. The~ Importance of Fire fighting Equipment cannot be over stretched as they ensure maximum protection  against  Fire. The  Fire Fighting~Equipment also ensures safety of the fire fighters themselves who  risk their lives to  save others.  There  are many  and different  types  of fire fighting equipment available to the fire fighte r~Some  major  ones are:~The Fi re Extinguisher â Fire Extinguisher is the primar y need of any smal l or big establishment .

As noted  in the Importance of Fire Protection in Buildings (2018), fire safety is of the highest importance in any building,  to ensure  safety  of the employees  and the protection of  the building.  Fire protection systems  and procedures  are a legal  requirement and need  to be put in place  in buildings  to make employees  aware  in the event  of a fire and they should understand that, fire safety is of the highest  importance in  any building, to  ensure their safety and the protection of the buildings~Buildings  must  comply  with The  Regulatory~Requirements of Fire Safet y, which applies to general fire safety across the bo ard and both residential and work premises are required to provide  minimum  fire safety  standards,  with~42Tropical Built Environment Journal (TBEJ) Vol. 8, No. 1, 2021 individuals having the responsibility to  carry out risk assessments to identif y, manage and reduce the risk of fire.~To comply  with the Fire Safety  Orde r, firstly  a fire risk assessment  must  always  be carried  out by the person  responsible. This  is where  employees  are provided with the adequate fire safety training, in order  to carry  out the correct  procedures  in case of an emergenc y. It's crucial  that fire detection and suppressio n system s are alway s completel y functional, including ensuring the appropriate equipmen t is properl y installed , teste d and maintained  for safe use in the event  of a fire. A fire alarm detection system is designed to sense smoke, extreme heat or fire and provide a high frequenc y alert to personne l throughou t a building. Fire alarms need to be installed in centralized  areas  and should  also be installed  in the head  of stairways  on every  floor  of a multi -storey structure. The  detection  systems  can be activated automatically or  manuall y, via call points  on the wall. It is vital these systems are installed and operate  effectivel y, to protect  life from  the danger of a fire. A fire  suppression  system  is used to prevent  and extinguish  fire in a building,  using  dry chemicals  or wet agents. The  types  of systems include,  inert gases,  Co2 and water  mist.~The chemical agent is released after the fire suppression  system detects smoke and raises an alarm. The  sounders  are the final warning  before the agent is released. Fire extinguishers play a crucial role in protecting buildings, by fighting fires in their early stages. Located in easily accessible  spots,  fire extinguishers  can be used by anyone  to eliminate  fires,  using  chemicals  such as,~wate r, powde r, foam,  Co2 and wet chemical.~Fire safety signs provide clear guidance to mark the location of  equipment, fire  alarm activation points, warning signs and fire exits.Through imagery and text, employees are aware of where they can find the correct  equipment  in case of an emergenc y. Every business needs specially trained individuals who ensure safe evacuation of everyone  on the premises  in a fire emergenc y~These are called fire marshals or fire wardens~Depending  on the business  and size, more than one fire marshal  may be needed  (Importance  of fire protection  in buildings,  2018).~Conclusion~Fire station  in an area is a necessity  and not to be negotiated  because  of the services  they provide~A fire station  is a facility  or structure  for storing fire fighting apparatus such  as fire fighting equipment , vehicles , personne l protectiv e equipment and so many others. In most cases,~they have working and living space for the fire fighters  and support  staff. These  are primarily important  for every  community  to have. The personnel of the fire stations prevent fires and protect  buildings,  attend  to accidents  in accident sites and save lives. House,  industrial and accident  fires kill and injure  thousands  of people yearly  and at the same  time,  cost a lot of people their valued  possessions  and memories. Not only that fire stations are needed in every communit y, regional fire stations are equally important  because,  they are the places  where  the staff of the community fire  stations  are trained and seminars  conducted.  In order  to provide  safe operations  and improved  health  and wellness  of the fire fighting personnel in the region, a regional  fire fighting  station  will be needed~A regional  fire fighting  station  is needed  in a region in order to provide safe operations and improved  health  and wellness  of the fire fighting personnel  in that region. This  facility  will not only provide  facilities  for equipment  and apparatus storage, but would provide working and living  space  for the fire fighters  and support staff. Staying and working in a fire fighting station  is not only boring  according  to most  staff of the fire fighting stations in  South  East~Nigeria,  but also treacherous  to their lives.~43                                Fire Outb reaks in the Southeast  Nigeria  And Inadequacies  In Service  And Fighting  Stations.~To avoid  these  situations,  this paper  recommends creating an inclusive environment for the sta ff,~where they would  have the opportunity to meet people from the communit y, exercise themselves and have the privileg e of workin g in an environment  with an eating  establishment.~REFERENCES~Agbili  M.

Onwume re, Basilia O.; Ihekuna, Chinonye Prisca; Johnson, Jessica Ogechi; Obiadi, Bons and. Onuorah I. M..Abstract:.Southeast  Nigeria  lacks  and needs  an up-to-date fire service  station.  The impression  and the general attitude  of the public  towards  the services  provided  by the fire service  agency  are discouraging.  People are still living  in the past and without  the knowledge  of what  the services  of the agency  are. They  are used to seeing  old and abandoned  fire stations  and fire apparatus  without  knowing  what  they are used for hence,  the need for education  and awareness  of the services  of the agenc y. The primary  aim of this study  is to bring  to the attention  of Enugu  State,  Federal  Government  of Nigeria  and the people  of the southeast  region  that, there  is no Regional  Fire Service  and Fighting  Station  in the region.  This study investigated inadequate fire service and fighting stations in southeast, Nigeria and the architectural solutions  and policies  to ameliorate  the problems. The  disciplinary  focus  area of this study  is architecture as such; content base analysis was used and looked into previous studies done in the subject  matter  by different  authors.  Enugu,  in Enugu  State,  has a fire service  station  located  along  Ogui. Road  opposite  the NIPOST  and built in the 1960's  by the colonial  masters.  It was the first fire service station built by the colonial master which served the old eastern region and till date, it is still in its original  state without  modifications.  The need  for a modern  day fire station  in an area is a necessity  and not to be negotiated  because  of the services  they provide.  A regional  fire fighting  station  is needed  in a region  in order  to provide  fire fighting  services,  safety  operations,  improved  health  and wellness  of the fire fighting  personnel  in that region.  This paper  recommends  creating  an inclusive  environment  for the staff, where  they would  have  the opportunity  to meet  people  from  the communit y, exercise  themselves and have  the privilege  of working  in an environment  with an eating  establishment..Key words:  Enugu,  population,  congestion,  fire outbreak,  architecture,  fire fighting.\n"
